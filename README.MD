## So, is this just snake?
Well, yes but actually yes.

Here are some cool features in this implementation:

    - Dynamic map size. (The map gets bigger every 10 points.)

    - God mode.

    - The ability to change map size manually.
    
    - The ability to change snake length manually.
    
    - The ability to change snake speed manually.
